# system-si-bot
# Description:
The International System of Units (SI) is the modern form of the metric system. I create a bot that will skillfully use this system and help users to convert units.
# Usage:
Find the bot in the telegram by username: system_si_bot. Start working with the bot by looking at the list of its commands. The **/instructions** command will introduce you to a brief manual on using the bot. The **/constants** command allows you to get data on all physical constants. And finally, the **/systemsi** command allows you to use the system of the same name. 
# Code:
The SI system is powered by code written in the [SIsystem.js](https://github.com/Dmytrenko-Roman/system-si-bot/blob/master/main/SIsystem.js) file. The implementation of constants is in the [constants.js](https://github.com/Dmytrenko-Roman/system-si-bot/blob/master/main/constants.js) file. I also wrote tests for these two functions. They are in the [tests.js](https://github.com/Dmytrenko-Roman/system-si-bot/blob/master/main/tests.js) file. The bot implementation is in the [index.js](https://github.com/Dmytrenko-Roman/system-si-bot/blob/master/main/index.js) file.
