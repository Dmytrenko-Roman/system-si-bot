# system-si-bot
# Description:
The International System of Units (SI) is the modern form of the metric system. I create a bot that will skillfully use this system and help users to convert units.
# Usage:
Find the bot in the telegram by username: system_si_bot. Start working with the bot by looking at the list of its commands. The /instructions command will introduce you to a brief manual on using the bot. The /constants command allows you to get data on all physical constants. And finally, the /systemsi command allows you to use the system of the same name. 
# Code:
The SI system is powered by code written in the SIsystem.js file.
